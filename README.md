## About

Oksana-Openko-sexologist is a multi-page adaptive website of sexologist
services.  
Welcome to the website of sexologist Oksana Openko. Here you will find useful
resources, videos, articles and counselling on sexology and family
relationships. The simple and unobtrusive design of the site is combined with
good functionality and a convenient menu. The site has a form for choosing the
format of services, the data of which is sent to the number of the site owner
via messenger Telegram.  
I have implemented the form for sending data to the server, site header, mobile
menu, navigation.
